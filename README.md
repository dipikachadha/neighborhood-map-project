# Neighborhood Map Project
Capstone project for the Udacity Frontend Web Developer Nano-degree program.

The application displays a list of Indian eateries in Cary, NC. Maps are updated via Google, and information about the venues is fetched via FourSquare.

# Using the Application
Clone the project:
```
git clone https://github.com/dipikachadha/neighborhood-map-project.git
```

Navigate to the folder and open `dist/index.html`. The app should load a map of Cary, NC showing Indian eateries.


You can filter the list by typing into the search bar.


An information window containing FourSquare results pops up when a location is clicked on the map or the list display.
